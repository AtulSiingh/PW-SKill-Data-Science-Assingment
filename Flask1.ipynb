    "\n",
    "App routing in Flask refers to the process of defining URL paths and associating them with specific functions or views. It's done using the @app.route() decorator. Routes define the paths that users can visit in the application, and each route is associated with a function that returns the content to be displayed on that path.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use app routes to map URL paths to specific functions in the application. This allows the application to respond to different URLs with different content or functionality. For example, you can have routes for different pages like home, about, contact, etc. App routing is essential for building the structure and navigation of web applications"
