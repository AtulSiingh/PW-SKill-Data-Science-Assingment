    "\n",
    "**Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **database** is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows efficient retrieval, management, and manipulation of the data. Databases are commonly used in various applications to store and retrieve data. There are two main categories of databases: **SQL** (Structured Query Language) and **NoSQL** (Not Only SQL).\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL Databases:**\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data. They store data in tables with predefined schemas. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NoSQL Databases:**\n",
    "NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that store and retrieve data in formats other than tabular relations used in SQL databases. They are more flexible and can handle unstructured and semi-structured data. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB (document-based), Cassandra (column-family), and Redis (key-value).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**DDL** stands for **Data Definition Language**, and it is used to define and manage the structure of the database. It includes statements for creating, altering, and deleting database objects like tables, indexes, and views.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CREATE**: Used to create new database objects. For example, creating a new table:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  CREATE TABLE Students (\n",
    "      ID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "      Name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "      Age INT\n",
    "  );\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DROP**: Used to delete database objects. For example, dropping a table:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  DROP TABLE Students;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ALTER**: Used to modify existing database objects. For example, adding a new column to a table:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  ALTER TABLE Students\n",
    "  ADD COLUMN Gender CHAR(1);\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TRUNCATE**: Used to remove all records from a table while keeping the table structure intact:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  TRUNCATE TABLE Students;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**DML** stands for **Data Manipulation Language**, and it is used to manipulate data within the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **INSERT**: Used to insert new records into a table:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  INSERT INTO Students (ID, Name, Age)\n",
    "  VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 20);\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **UPDATE**: Used to modify existing records in a table:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  UPDATE Students\n",
    "  SET Age = 21\n",
    "  WHERE Name = 'John Doe';\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DELETE**: Used to delete records from a table:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  DELETE FROM Students\n",
    "  WHERE ID = 1;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**DQL** stands for **Data Query Language**, and it is used to retrieve data from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SELECT**: Used to retrieve data from one or more tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT Name, Age\n",
    "  FROM Students\n",
    "  WHERE Age > 18;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary Key**: A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each record in that table. It ensures that each row has a unique identifier, and it also enforces data integrity. For example, in the `Students` table, the `ID` column could be the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Foreign Key**: A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables. For example, if you have a `Courses` table and a `Students` table, the `StudentID` column in the `Courses` table could be a foreign key referencing the `ID` column in the `Students` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. Write a python code to connect MySQL to python. Explain the cursor() and execute() method.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to connect to a MySQL database using Python and the `mysql-connector` library:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mysql.connector\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to the database\n",
    "db_connection = mysql.connector.connect(\n",
    "    host=\"localhost\",\n",
    "    user=\"username\",\n",
    "    password=\"password\",\n",
    "    database=\"mydatabase\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a cursor\n",
    "cursor = db_connection.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Execute an SQL query\n",
    "query = \"SELECT * FROM Students\"\n",
    "cursor.execute(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetch and print the results\n",
    "results = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "for row in results:\n",
    "    print(row)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the cursor and the connection\n",
    "cursor.close()\n",
    "db_connection.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code:\n",
    "- `mysql.connector.connect()` is used to establish a connection to the MySQL database.\n",
    "- `cursor()` creates a cursor object, which is used to execute SQL statements and fetch results.\n",
    "- `execute()` is used to execute an SQL query.\n",
    "- `fetchall()` retrieves all the rows of the result set.\n",
    "- After fetching the data, the cursor and the database connection are closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of execution of SQL clauses in a query is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FROM**: Specifies the tables from which the data will be retrieved.\n",
    "2. **JOIN**: Combines multiple tables based on specified conditions.\n",
    "3. **WHERE**: Filters the rows based on a specified condition.\n",
    "4. **GROUP BY**: Groups the result set based on specified columns.\n",
    "5. **HAVING**: Filters the grouped result set based on a condition.\n",
    "6. **SELECT**: Specifies the columns to be included in the result.\n",
    "7. **DISTINCT**: Removes duplicate rows from the result set (optional).\n",
    "8. **ORDER BY**: Sorts the result set based on specified columns.\n",
    "9. **LIMIT/OFFSET**: Restricts the number of rows returned (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
