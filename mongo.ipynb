    "**Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios is it preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**MongoDB** is a popular open-source NoSQL database that falls under the category of non-relational databases. Non-relational databases are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and offer more flexibility compared to traditional SQL databases. They use various data models, such as document-based, key-value, column-family, and graph databases, to store and retrieve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases like MongoDB are preferred in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Flexible Schema**: The data structure is not well-defined or is subject to frequent changes.\n",
    "2. **Scalability**: The application needs to handle a large volume of data and demands horizontal scalability.\n",
    "3. **Complex Data**: The data contains nested or hierarchical structures.\n",
    "4. **Rapid Development**: Projects that require quick iterations and adaptability.\n",
    "5. **Real-time Analytics**: Applications that require fast and real-time analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is often chosen over SQL databases for these scenarios due to its schema-less design, horizontal scalability, and ability to handle unstructured or semi-structured data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.**\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB offers several key features, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document-Oriented**: Data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents instead of tables with fixed schemas.\n",
    "2. **Schema Flexibility**: Documents within a collection can have different structures.\n",
    "3. **Scalability**: Supports horizontal scaling using sharding to distribute data across multiple servers.\n",
    "4. **High Availability**: Provides automatic failover and replication to ensure data availability.\n",
    "5. **Indexing**: Supports various types of indexes to improve query performance.\n",
    "6. **Aggregation**: Offers powerful aggregation framework for data processing and transformation.\n",
    "7. **Query Language**: Provides a rich query language for filtering, sorting, and aggregating data.\n",
    "8. **Geospatial Support**: Enables location-based queries and geospatial indexing.\n",
    "9. **Full-Text Search**: Allows efficient text-based searching in documents.\n",
    "10. **Ad Hoc Queries**: Supports dynamic queries against documents using various operators.\n",
    "11. **MapReduce**: Allows complex data processing and transformation.\n",
    "12. **Document Validation**: Validates and enforces data integrity based on specified rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to connect to MongoDB using the `pymongo` library in Python and create a database and a collection:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to MongoDB\n",
    "client = MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a database and a collection\n",
    "db = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "collection = db[\"mycollection\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Using the database and the collection created in question number 3, write a code to insert one record and insert many records. Use the find() and find_one() methods to print the inserted record.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Insert one record\n",
    "record = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 25}\n",
    "collection.insert_one(record)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert many records\n",
    "records = [\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 28}\n",
    "]\n",
    "collection.insert_many(records)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print inserted record using find_one()\n",
    "print(\"One Record:\")\n",
    "print(collection.find_one({\"name\": \"John\"}))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print inserted records using find()\n",
    "print(\"All Records:\")\n",
    "for record in collection.find():\n",
    "    print(record)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. Explain how you can use the find() method to query the MongoDB database. Write a simple code to demonstrate this.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `find()` method in MongoDB is used to query documents from a collection based on specified criteria. It returns a cursor to the result set, which can be iterated over.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Query and print documents with age greater than 25\n",
    "query = {\"age\": {\"$gt\": 25}}\n",
    "cursor = collection.find(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Query Result:\")\n",
    "for record in cursor:\n",
    "    print(record)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. Explain the sort() method. Give an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sort()` method in MongoDB is used to specify the sorting order of query results. It takes a dictionary where keys represent fields to sort by, and values indicate the sorting order (1 for ascending, -1 for descending).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Sort documents by age in descending order\n",
    "sorted_cursor = collection.find().sort(\"age\", -1)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Sorted Result:\")\n",
    "for record in sorted_cursor:\n",
    "    print(record)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. Explain why delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() is used.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **delete_one()**: This method is used to delete a single document from a collection based on a specified filter. It deletes the first document that matches the filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **delete_many()**: This method is used to delete multiple documents from a collection based on a specified filter. It deletes all documents that match the filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **drop()**: This method is used to completely remove a collection, including all its documents, from the database. It's a way to delete an entire collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are used when you need to remove data from a collection or delete a collection entirely."
